## Initial Idea

I want to keep track of my personal finances privately. This application will be beautiful, easy to use, totally private, and offline-capable. As a software developer, I'll build it with the following key features:

### Core Features
- Upload and parse financial statements (Excel/PDF)
- Local AI analysis for data processing
- Rich data visualization and graphs
- Multi-account support across:
  - Traditional bank accounts
  - Credit cards
  - Investment accounts
  - Cryptocurrency wallets
  - Custom account types

### Technical Approach

#### Desktop Application
- Cross-platform desktop app using Electron + React
- Local file storage for uploads and processed data
- SQLite for efficient data management
- Account aggregation and reconciliation

#### Local AI Integration
- TensorFlow.js/ONNX Runtime for offline AI
- Smart transaction categorization
- Pattern recognition for insights
- Natural language processing for search

#### Data Visualization
- Interactive graphs with D3.js/Chart.js
- Customizable dashboards
- Cross-account analytics
- Portfolio overview and balance tracking

#### Security & Privacy
- Local encryption for sensitive data
- Password protection
- Offline-first architecture
- Optional multi-device sync

#### Advanced Features
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Custom categories and rules
- Predictive analysis
- Anomaly detection
- Multi-currency support
- Consolidated reporting across accounts

This approach creates a powerful, private finance tracking system that can handle multiple accounts while maintaining complete user privacy and offline capabilities.
